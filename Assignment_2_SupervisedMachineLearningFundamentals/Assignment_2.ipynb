    ">Before addressing the following scenarios, it is important to note that there are no strict rules to determine whether a flexible or inflexible method is preferable. The choice depends on various factors, such as the interpretability of the model and computational efficiency.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">For example, if interpretability is highly valued or there are computational limitations, an inflexible model may be preferable. Its simplicity facilitates understanding, and its lower complexity can be more efficient in terms of computational resources.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">Therefore, we will consider that, while the choice between flexible and inflexible methods depends on the specific context, in the following questions, we will approach the scenarios with a general perspective.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">1 . The sample size $n$ is extremely large, and the number of predictors $p$ is small.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this case, we would prefer a `flexible model` since, with an extremely large sample size and a small number of predictors $p$, we can train the model more robustly, avoiding overfitting, and leveraging the flexible model's ability to capture complex patterns. If the number of predictors $p$ is small, the additional complexity of a flexible model is not a significant problem.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">2 . The number of predictors $p$ is extremely large, and the number of observations $n$ is small.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this scenario, opting for a `inflexible model` would be better. This is because, with an extremely large number of predictors $p$ and a small sample size $n$, a highly flexible model could struggle to generalize effectively. The additional complexity could lead to significant overfitting, especially given the limited number of observations available to reliably estimate the relationships among so many predictors.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">3 . The relationship between the predictors and response is highly non-linear.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this scenario, opting for a `flexible model` is preferable to capture the underlying patterns between the independent and dependent variables. However, it's crucial to be cautious, as excessive flexibility could lead to overfitting. Finding a balance is generally expected. Nonetheless, choosing an inflexible model, such as linear regression, would not be recommended due to the highly non-linear nature of the relationship between predictors and the response.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">4 . The variance of the error terms, i.e. $\\sigma^2 = Var(\\epsilon)$, is extremely high\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In this scenario, choosing a `inflexible model` is preferable. Given the high level of variability, employing a highly flexible model tends to closely fit to this variability in our data, resulting in overfitting. A less flexible model, with better generalization capability, would be more appropriate."
