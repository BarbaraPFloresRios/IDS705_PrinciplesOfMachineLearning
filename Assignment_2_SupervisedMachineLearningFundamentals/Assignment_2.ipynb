Linear regression can be used to model nonlinear relationships when feature variables are properly transformed to represent the nonlinearities in the data.

Provide the estimated equation for this multiple regression model (e.g. if you chose your predictors to be $z_1 = x$ and $z_2 = log(x)$, your model would be of the form $y = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 log(x)$.
