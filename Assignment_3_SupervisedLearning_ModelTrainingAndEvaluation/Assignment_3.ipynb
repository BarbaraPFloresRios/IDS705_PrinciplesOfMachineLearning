    "This exercise will walk you through the full life-cycle of a supervised machine learning classification problem. Classification problem consists of two features/predictors (e.g. petal width and petal length) and your goal is to predict one of two possible classes (class 0 or class 1). You will build, train, and evaluate the performance of a logistic regression classifier on the data provided. Before you begin any modeling, you'll load and explore your data in Part I to familiarize yourself with it - and check for any missing or erroneous data. Then, in Part II, we will review an appropriate hypothesis set of functions to fit to the data: in this case, logistic regression. In Part III, we will derive an appropriate cost function for the data (spoiler alert: it's cross-entropy) as well as the gradient descent update equation that will allow you to optimize that cost function to identify the parameters that minimize the cost for the training data. In Part IV, all the pieces come together and you will implement your logistic regression model class including methods for fitting the data using gradient descent. Using that model you'll test it out and plot learning curves to verify the model learns as you train it and to identify and appropriate learning rate hyperparameter. Lastly, in Part V you will apply the model you designed, implemented, and verified to your actual data and evaluate and visualize its generalization performance as compared to a KNN algorithm. **When complete, you will have accomplished learning objectives 1-5 above!**\n",

    "### I. Load, prepare, and plot your data\n",

    "- Divide your data into a training and testing set where the test set accounts for 30 percent of the data and the training set the remaining 70 percent.  \n",
    "- Plot the training data by class. \n",
    "- Comment on the data: do the data appear separable? May logistic regression be a good choice for these data? Why or why not?\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** Do the data require any preprocessing due to missing values, scale differences (e.g. different ranges of values), etc.? If so, how did you handle these issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we walk through our key steps for model fitting: choose a hypothesis set of models to train (in this case, logistic regression); identify a cost function to measure the model fit to our training data; optimize model parameters to minimize cost (in this case using gradient descent). Once we've completed model fitting, we will evaluate the performance of our model and compare performance to another approach (a KNN classifier)."

You are also welcome to use $\\sigma()$ to represent the sigmoid function.

    "- Create a method called `sigmoid` that calculates the sigmoid function\n",
    "- Create a method called `cost` that computes the cost function $C(\\mathbf{w})$ for a given dataset and corresponding class labels. This should be the **average cost** (make sure your total cost is divided by your number of samples in the dataset).\n",
    "- Create a method called `gradient_descent` to run **one step** of gradient descent on your training data. We'll refer to this as \"batch\" gradient descent since it takes into account the gradient based on all our data at each iteration of the algorithm. \n",
    "- Create a method called `fit` that fits the model to the data (i.e. sets the model parameters to minimize cost) using your `gradient_descent` method. In doing this we'll need to make some assumptions about the following:\n",
    "    - Weight initialization. What should you initialize the model parameters to? For this, randomly initialize the weights to a different values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    - Learning rate. How slow/fast should the algorithm step towards the minimum? This you will vary in a later part of this problem.\n",
    "    - Stopping criteria. When should the algorithm be finished searching for the optimum? There are two stopping criteria: small changes in the gradient descent step size and a maximum number of iterations. The first is whether there was a sufficiently small change in the gradient; this is evaluated as whether the magnitude of the step that the gradient descent algorithm takes changes by less than $10^{-6}$ between iterations. Since we have a weight vector, we can compute the change in the weight by evaluating the $L_2$ norm (Euclidean norm) of the change in the vector between iterations. From our gradient descent update equation we know that mathematically this is $||-\\eta\\nabla_{\\mathbf{w}}C(\\mathbf{w})||$. The second criterion is met if a maximum number of iterations has been reach (5,000 in this case, to prevent infinite loops from poor choices of learning rates).\n",
    "    - Design your approach so that at each step in the gradient descent algorithm you evaluate the cost function for both the training and the test data for each new value for the model weights. You should be able to plot cost vs gradient descent iteration for both the training and the test data. This will allow you to plot \"learning curves\" that can be informative for how the model training process is proceeding.\n",
    "- Create a method called `predict_proba` that predicts confidence scores (that can be thresholded into the predictions of the `predict` method.\n",
    "- Create a method called `predict` that makes predictions based on the trained model, selecting the most probable class, given the data, as the prediction, that is class that yields the larger $P(y|\\mathbf{x})$.\n",
    "- (Optional, but recommended) Create a method called `learning_curve` that produces the cost function values that correspond to each step from a previously run gradient descent operation.\n",
    "- (Optional, but recommended) Create a method called `prepare_x` which appends a column of ones as the first feature of the dataset $\\mathbf{X}$ to account for the bias term ($x_{i,1}=1$).\n",

Your goal is to train a classifier that is able to distinguish the number \"3\" from all possible numbers and to do so as accurately as possible. You will first explore your data (this should always be your starting point to gain domain knowledge about the problem.). Since the feature space in this problem is 784-dimensional, overfitting is possible. To avoid overfitting you will investigate the impact of regularization on generalization performance (test accuracy) and compare regularized and unregularized logistic regression model test error against other classification techniques such as linear discriminant analysis and random forests and draw conclusions about the best-performing model.\n",

MNIST has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.\n",

Using a logistic regression classifier, apply lasso regularization and retrain the model and evaluate its performance on the test set over a range of values on the regularization coefficient. You can implement this using the [LogisticRegression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) module and activating the 'l1' penalty; the parameter $C$ is the inverse of the regularization strength. Vary the value of C logarithmically from $10^{-4}$ to $10^4$ (and make your x-axes logarithmic in scale) and evaluate it at least 20 different values of C. As you vary the regularization coefficient, Plot the following four quantities (this should result in 4 separate plots)... \n",
