In machine learning, we iterate over so much data that those loops can lead to significant slow downs if they are not computationally efficient. In Python, vectorizing code and relying on matrix operations with efficient tools like numpy is typically the faster approach. Of course, numpy relies on loops to complete the computation, but this is at a lower level of programming (typically in C), and therefore is much more efficient. This exercise will explore the benefits of vectorization. Since many machine learning techniques rely on matrix operations, it's helpful to begin thinking about implementing algorithms using vector forms.\n",

    ">\n",
    ">In November 2022, Chile introduced a new selection test for access to higher education, the \"PAES: Prueba de Acceso a la Educación Superior\" (Higher Education Access Test). This test replaces the \"PSU: Prueba de Selección Universitaria\" (University Selection Test), which had been in use for almost 20 years.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">One of the objectives of the test change was to improve equity in access to higher education among students from private and public schools. The new test focuses more on understanding and applying knowledge, reducing the importance of memorization of facts and formulas. The hypothesis is that this change should particularly benefit students from public schools.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">However, the results of the second administration of the test were published on January 2, 2024, and the media has suggested that notable disparities persist among various types of establishments.\n",
    ">\n",
    ">We lack access to detailed data from the previous PSU test, and considering that both tests operate on distinct scales, conducting a thorough comparison becomes challenging within the confines of this examination. That's why, in this analysis, we will focus on understanding the performance of the current test. The goal is to grasp the differences that exist today in the results of the test that determines the university future of Chilean students. Therefore, the research question we aim to address in this analysis is:\n",
